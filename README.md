# ts-validate
Validation library for TypeScript/JavaScript supporting sync and async validation with state

## Current status
*Work-in-progress*

## Background
Initially ts-validate started out as a port of shelakel/elm-validate.
This library aims to be easy to use.

Validation produces validation state "diffs" that is compatible with
most immutable implementations and redux time-travelling (JSON serialization of state).

## Example
